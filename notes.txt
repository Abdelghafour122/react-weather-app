ISSUES:
CITY SEARCH IS LAGGY, CAN'T SEARCH IF THE LANGUAGE IS SET TO ARABIC

MAKE AN ERROR PAGE FOR INTERNET ERRORS AND FOR FETCH ERRORS

Next Steps: 
.Make the search better (city search) and the AutoComplete
.Try make the loading skeleton
.Make responsive styles
.Make an error page if data is undefined (if data === undefined it will not stop loading)

Fixed the themeswitch temporarily
(IN ALL SWITCHERS):
Use a index switcher instead of the name (the name changes but not the number)
